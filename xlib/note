This is a great way to learn graphics, and your instinct is spot-on 👍
What you’re asking for is basically:

“Give me a learning roadmap, not the answer. I want to re-derive this final code step by step, the same way frontend devs build a form feature by feature.”

Below is a procedural, incremental implementation plan for Xlib + raycasting, broken into tiny, testable milestones.
Think of each step as: compile → run → verify visually or via printf.

I’ll stay conceptual + procedural, not dumping new code unless it helps understanding.
