# Vector Math - Course 2: Vector Operations

In this course, we will cover the common operations performed with vectors, including:

1. **Addition** and **Subtraction**
2. **Scalar Multiplication**
3. **Dot Product**
4. **Cross Product** (3D vectors only)

## 1. Vector Addition & Subtraction

### Addition

When adding two vectors, you simply add their corresponding components:

- **2D**:  
  If `v = <x₁, y₁>` and `w = <x₂, y₂>`, then: `v + w = <x₁ + x₂, y₁ + y₂>`
- **3D**:  
If `v = <x₁, y₁, z₁>` and `w = <x₂, y₂, z₂>`, then: `v + w = <x₁ + x₂, y₁ + y₂, z₁ + z₂>`

### Subtraction

Subtraction is similar to addition, just subtracting corresponding components:

- **2D**: `v - w = <x₁ - x₂, y₁ - y₂>`
- **3D**: `v - w = <x₁ - x₂, y₁ - y₂, z₁ - z₂>`

## 2. Scalar Multiplication

To multiply a vector by a scalar (a single number), you multiply each component of the vector by the scalar:

- **2D**:  
If `v = <x, y>` and `k` is a scalar, then: `k * v = <k * x, k * y>`
- **3D**:  
If `v = <x, y, z>` and `k` is a scalar, then: `k * v = <k * x, k * y, k * z>`


This operation **scales** the vector, changing its magnitude while maintaining its direction.

## 3. Dot Product

The **dot product** of two vectors produces a scalar and is used to calculate angles and projections.

### Formula

- **2D**:  
If `v = <x₁, y₁>` and `w = <x₂, y₂>`, the dot product is: `v · w = x₁ * x₂ + y₁ * y₂`
- **3D**:  
For `v = <x₁, y₁, z₁>` and `w = <x₂, y₂, z₂>`, the formula becomes: `v · w = x₁ * x₂ + y₁ * y₂ + z₁ * z₂`


#### Geometric Interpretation

The **dot product** also relates to the **cosine of the angle** between the two vectors: `v · w = |v| * |w| * cos(θ)`


Where:
- `|v|` and `|w|` are the magnitudes of `v` and `w`
- `θ` is the angle between `v` and `w`

If the dot product is 0, it means the vectors are **orthogonal** (perpendicular).

---

## 4. Cross Product (3D Only)

The **cross product** is only defined for **3D vectors** and results in a vector that is **perpendicular** to the two input vectors.

### Formula

If `v = <x₁, y₁, z₁>` and `w = <x₂, y₂, z₂>`, then the cross product `v × w` is: `v × w = <(y₁ * z₂ - z₁ * y₂), (z₁ * x₂ - x₁ * z₂), (x₁ * y₂ - y₁ * x₂)>`


This resulting vector is perpendicular to both `v` and `w` and can be used in various applications, such as finding surface normals in graphics.

## C Code Examples

### Vector Addition and Subtraction

```c
// Vector addition
Vector2 add(Vector2 v, Vector2 w) {
    Vector2 result = {v.x + w.x, v.y + w.y};
    return result;
}

// Vector subtraction
Vector2 subtract(Vector2 v, Vector2 w) {
    Vector2 result = {v.x - w.x, v.y - w.y};
    return result;
}
```
```c
// Scalar multiplication (2D)
Vector2 scalar_multiply(Vector2 v, float scalar) {
    Vector2 result = {v.x * scalar, v.y * scalar};
    return result;
}
```
```c
// Dot product (2D)
float dot_product(Vector2 v, Vector2 w) {
    return v.x * w.x + v.y * w.y;
}
```
```c
// Cross product (3D)
Vector3 cross_product(Vector3 v, Vector3 w) {
    Vector3 result = {
        v.y * w.z - v.z * w.y,
        v.z * w.x - v.x * w.z,
        v.x * w.y - v.y * w.x
    };
    return result;
}
```

## Common Uses in Programming

* **Dot Product:** Finding angles between vectors (e.g., light reflection, camera view)
* **Cross Product:** Finding normals (e.g., 3D object surfaces)
* **Scalar Multiplication:** Scaling vectors for movement, forces, etc.
* **Vector Addition/Subtraction:** Calculating relative positions and directions
