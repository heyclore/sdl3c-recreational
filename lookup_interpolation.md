## Key Terms & Topics to Learn

### Core Concepts

| Term                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lookup Table (LUT)**   | A predefined table of input/output values used to avoid real-time computation. |
| **Interpolation**        | Estimating unknown values between known data points.                        |
| **Linear Interpolation (Lerp)** | Blending between two values based on a percentage (1D).                   |
| **Bilinear Interpolation** | Blending between four values in a 2D grid (e.g., angle Ã— power).            |
| **Trilinear Interpolation** | Interpolation across three variables (e.g., angle Ã— power Ã— wind).          |
| **Empirical Modeling**   | Using observed data instead of theoretical formulas.                        |
| **Heuristic**            | A simplified rule or logic for decision-making or estimation.               |
| **Tunable Parameters**   | Values that can be manually adjusted to change the behavior of a system.    |
| **Fuzzy Logic**          | A method for working with approximate or uncertain values.                  |

### Game Development Terms

| Term                       | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Game Feel / Juice**      | Tuning a system to feel responsive and satisfying, rather than being physically exact. |
| **Data-Driven Design**     | Designing behavior and rules using modifiable data rather than hardcoded logic. |
| **Balancing**              | Adjusting gameplay variables to achieve fun, fairness, or realism.         |
| **Procedural Systems**     | Generating content or behavior using algorithms and data rules.            |
| **State Machine / Decision Tree** | A method of controlling game logic using defined states or branches.          |

|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Approximation Algorithms** | Simple methods for computing "good enough" answers quickly.                 |
| **Surrogate Modeling**      | A simplified model that mimics a more complex one using observed data.      |
| **Curve Fitting / Regression** | Creating mathematical functions to fit a dataset.                           |
| **Discrete Sampling**       | Representing a continuous space with a limited set of data points.         |

|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Function Approximation** | Modeling an unknown function using data rather than an exact formula.       |
| **Feature Engineering**   | Selecting relevant inputs (features) to describe a problem.                |
| **Non-Parametric Models** | Models that use stored data instead of a fixed number of parameters.       |

## ðŸ›  Suggested Learning Path

1. Learn interpolation basics:
   - Linear interpolation (1D)
   - Bilinear interpolation (2D)
2. Build a toy system using a lookup table (in Python, Unity, etc.)
3. Experiment in a game engine (Unity, Godot, etc.)
4. Study these topics:
   - Data-Driven Game Design
   - Game Programming Patterns
   - Empirical and Approximate Modeling
5. Explore fuzzy logic or heuristic systems for decision-making
